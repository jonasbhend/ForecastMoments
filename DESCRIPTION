Description: Infomation about the quality of a probabilistic forecast
    can be revealed by exploring the joint distribution of past forecasts 
    (hindcasts) with corresponding observations. This package estimates
    6 low order moments that fully characterize the joint distribution for 
    Gaussian variables along with functionality to assess uncertainty of 
    these low order moments and derived estimates based on paramtric 
    bootstrap resampling.
